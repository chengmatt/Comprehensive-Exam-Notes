# Broad Stock Assessment Questions

## Catch-per-unit effort data
- Detriments with using CPUE data
- Relation of life-history and detriments of CPUE data
- Goal of standardization
- How to ensure index is not hyperstable or hyperdepleted
- Spatial considerations

## Selectivity


## Data Weighting

## Complexity and Parsimony Tradeoffs
- Preventing over-parameterized models

## Time-Varying Processes
- How to best account for time-varying processes
- Resolving retrospective behaviors
- Ensuring retrospective behaviors are on the correct process
- Time-block vs. continuous methods


## Harvest Strategies + Reference Points
- How can yield be maximized (fish when cohort biomass is maximized)
- Spatial considerations
- YPR vs. SBPR vs. Fmsy (w/ recruitment)
- Impacts of recruitment on reference points
- Trade offs between M, growth, and fishing
- Impacts of selectivity on harvest
- Sex-specific considerations 
- Considerations of age-structure


### Reference Points w/ Time-Varying Processes
- Dealing with non-stationarity in reference points (dynamic reference points)
- Short-term forecasts with non-stationarity

## Assessment Diagnostics
