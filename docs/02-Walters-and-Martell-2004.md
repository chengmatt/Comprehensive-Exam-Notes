## Changing Objectives and Emerging Assessment Methods

### The Role of Predictive Models
Predictive models are needed because management agencies need to make decisions about what is preferred, and what might happen in the future. Thus, we need to choose some sort of model to make these decisions. In general, we don't need predictions to be unconditional of the future, but rather we generally need our predictions for policy to answer whether A is better than B, and which one is a better bet in the future (we only really need to know about relative performance). So if we were to get asked how can we manage fish without knowing how many are there, we can say "for a wide range of scenarios, policy X does better despite uncertainties in the system, in a simulation scenario". Additionally, predictions can be made/policy choices can be made to have responses to change - i.e., taking a fixed proportion of harvest vs. fixed catch. 

### Approaches to Prediction of Policy Impact
1. Conventional Wisdom and Dogma - Basically, managers will ignore policies that they deem as atypical and continue to operate as if no new evidence has been presented, especially when something does not align with their understanding of a system. 
1. Trend Extrapolation - Using historical data to forecast the future, either by eye or with time-series methods. However, this really only works when there are small gradual changes - fisheries can change rapidly. Additionally, this approach might not be appropriate if the index you are using is not representative (catch, CPUE, etc),
1. Empirical Models based on past experience - using comparative data from other species of systems to understand how those respond to policies and how that might apply to your system.
1. Reductionist Modelling - using tautologies and assumptions to create mathematical models, which keeps modelled components and associated predictions tractable to use and understand. But several things can go awry, namely, if you make the incorrect assumptions about functional forms, the propagation of error in previous states to future states can compound, etc.

### Experimental Management
The approach for experimental management is to create a wide range of policy options that are robust (maybe via simulation) and then apply these options to the system across some sort of treatment, to understand their relative impact. But generally, people don't like this approach because it's 'risky' and people generally prefer using models to figure out what options we should use.

#### Decision Marking Under Uncertainty
Uncertainty in our predictions are a result of 3 factors. 1) We never measure anything precisely, 2) we don't know the rules of change and how the system will respond, and 3) environmental impacts on predictions are not well known or understood. So even if we can measure things precisely, we never know how the environment will respond, resulting in substantial uncertainty in our predictions. 

In general, making decisions is hard (duh) irrespective of whether you have good predictions or not, just simply given the uncertainty you have in the system. We are often paralyzed by the indecision (or decision) of whether to make a decisive action (e.g., stop fishing) or to 'wait and see'.

### Ecological Basis for Sustainable Harvesting
In general, populations can grow at some rate $r$ and are generally mediated by density-dependent effects, rather than only density-independent effects. Given that there is often a compensatory mechanism in many animal populations, harvesting the population at a modest rate allows for an improved survival or fecundity, given a reduction in the population, and forms the ecological basis for sustainable harvesting. 

Some typical responses of populaations have been observed, which include:
1. For semelparous species, fecundity remains fairly constant, or declines when there are strong declines in old fish (no compensatory response)
1. Survival rates for old individuals generally do not show compensatory responses,
1. Juvenile survival rates show compensatory responses and can be independent of the number of eggs produced.

In terms of a surplus production model, we typically think of growth potentially having a larger effect on production of biomass, with a stronger influence that recruitment and we are generally interested in modifying the harvest rate to see what our total gains in production can be $Y_t = u_tN_tw$. However, its important to note that while increasing harvest rates helps with the compensatory response of the population, it also decreases your average abundance as well as your average weight of the population (because you are truncating your age-structure, and there are less old big fish left in the population). Nonetheless, a truncation in age-structure leads to more younger fast growing fish, which in turn leads to a higher growth rate on a per-capita basis. However, this is misleading, because we still need to account for the total number of individuals, irrespective of what happens to per-capita increases in growth rates.
