# Preface {-}

This bookdown contains notes on readings assigned to me from my committee, in preparation for my comprehensive exams in Spring 2024. I preface by noting that I am by no means an expert, and by no means are these derivations 100% correct (they're likely approximately correct), and this serves as a means for me to synthesize ideas and explore model assumptions. Currently, these readings are:

- Quantitative Fish Dynamics (Quinn and Deriso, 1999)
- Scaling Fisheries (Smith, 1994)
